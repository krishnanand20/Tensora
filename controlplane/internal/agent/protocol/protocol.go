// Package protocol is what node agents and the control plane say to each other (ADR-0016): one
// call, Sync. The agent sends what it has; the control plane answers with everything the machine
// should run, as soon as that changes or after a timeout (a long poll). In Solo it's a function
// call to the in-process agent; over the network (Phase 2) it's POST /agent/v1/sync over HTTPS with
// mutual TLS. The types are plain data with JSON tags, so both carry the same messages.
