description: Add a new tenant-scoped resource to the Tensora API end to end (migration, store, service, handlers, runtime manifests or driver specs, tests, web types). Use when asked to add an endpoint or resource to the control plane.

Follow [docs/playbooks/add-api-resource.md](../../../docs/playbooks/add-api-resource.md) step by step.

Resource to add: $ARGUMENTS

Before writing code, state:

- the resource's fields and lifecycle
- whether it runs anything (through Kubernetes or node agents), and under which trust levels
- whether it affects quotas or usage accounting (there is no billing)
- whether it's **regional** or **global**, and whether any **fallback** can serve it (AGENTS.md rules 9 and 10)

Ask if any of that is ambiguous. When you're done:

1. Run the `verify` skill.
2. Run the `tenancy-reviewer` subagent on the change.
