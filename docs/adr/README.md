# Architecture Decision Records

Short records of decisions that are expensive to reverse. To write one, follow
[docs/playbooks/write-an-adr.md](../playbooks/write-an-adr.md). Claude Code users can run `/new-adr`.

ADRs are history, so they're never rewritten. When a later decision changes an earlier one, the earlier
ADR gets a banner at the top saying what still applies. **Read the newest ADRs first:** 0011 to 0014
define today's product.

Statuses run Proposed → Accepted → (Superseded by NNNN | Deprecated). Never delete an ADR; supersede it.
